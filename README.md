Repository for ideas, resources, and discussions.

I am not really sure why I'm learning GitHub except that people at work use it and talk about it kind of holding up things I need for them to do, so I want to understand what they're trying to do. Also, a coworker is using it to help make improvements to a software I'm getting ready to learn.
